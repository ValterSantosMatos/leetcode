2048 is an interesting game, why not make our own in Python?!

1. Generate an initial board with a random number of `2`s at random cells, e.g.:
```json
[
    [2, null, 2, null],
    [null, 2, null, 2],
    [2, null, 2, null],
    [null, 2, null, 2]
]
```

2. Support *Merge Left* and *Merge Right* and generate a `2` or `4` for empty spaces at random cells. E.g.:

Before:
```json
[
    [2, null, 2, null],
    [null, 2, null, 2],
    [2, null, 2, null],
    [null, 2, null, 2]
]
```
After Merge Left:
```json
[
    [4, null, null, 2],
    [4, null, null, null],
    [4, 2, null, null],
    [4, null, null, null]
]
```

3. Support *Merge Up* and *Merge Down* and generate a `2` or `4` at new empty spaces. E.g.:

Before:
```json
[
    [null, null, 4, 8],
    [4, 4, 4, 4],
    [null, null, 4, 4],
    [null, 4, 4, 4]
]
```
After Merge Up:
```json
[
    [4, 8, 8, 8],
    [2, null, 8, 8],
    [null, null, null, 4],
    [2, null, null, 2]
]
```

4. Determine endgame. E.g.:

No more moves:
```json
[
    [2,4,2,4],
    [4,2,4,2],
    [2,4,2,4],
    [4,2,4,2]
]
```
